# Overview


As a software engineer I am trying to further my learning by practicing skills I have been introduced to in the past, and want to build my confidence in fundamentals of programing languages, in this case c#. 
The purpose is to deepen my understanding the syntax of c#, particularly understanding classes and how getters and setters work.
